## Overview
Identify consists of a set of protocols used to help identify remote peers within the libp2p ecosystem. The protocols included within Identify are...

- /ipfs/id 
   - This protocol exchanges Signed Peer Records used for confirming a remote Peer is who they claim to be, the addresses they're listening on and the protocols they speak.
- /ipfs/id/push
   - An extension of `/ipfs/id` that pushes changes to a Peers listening addresses and protocols as they update in realtime.
- /ipfs/id/delta
   - An extension of `/ipfs/id` that pushes `delta` (partial) Peer Records that contain changes since an initial `/ipfs/id` Peer Record exchange
- /ipfs/ping
   - A ping protocol that allows for quick and easy pings to libp2p Peers for measuring latency, testing liveness/connectivity, etc.

#### Heads up ‼️
- This package is embedded into [swift-libp2p](https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p) . There's no need to include this package as a dependency in your swift-libp2p project.

## Usage
#### Heads up ‼️
- This package is embedded into [swift-libp2p](https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-libp2p) . There's no need to include this package as a dependency in your swift-libp2p project.
```Swift

/// Tell swift-libp2p to use Identify (the standard swift-libp2p implementation does this automatically)
app.identityManager.use(.default)

```


### Example

```Swift

/// Manually ping a peer
app.identify.ping(peer: PeerID).map { 
    print("Latency: \($0)")
}

/// Manually ping a multiaddr
app.identify.ping(addr: Multiaddr).map { 
    print("Latency: \($0)")
}

```

### API
```Swift

/// Attempts to Ping a Peer, returns the time it took to receive a response.
public func ping(peer:PeerID) -> EventLoopFuture<TimeAmount> 

/// Attempts to Ping a Multiaddr, returns the time it took to receive a response.
public func ping(addr:Multiaddr) -> EventLoopFuture<TimeAmount>

```
